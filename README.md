# Multivariate longitudinal modeling with continuous time-varying endogenous covariates
Here one can find the R-code used within the context of the paper '*Multivariate longitudinal modeling with continuous time-varying endogenous covariates*'.

The folders are the following:
- **Simulation 65 vs 200** contains all the files used for the simulation shown in Section 5 of the paper. It contains:
     -   *Data* folder
- **Simulation default vs informative** contains all the files that are needed to compile the simulation that compare the models estimation with or without an informative hyperprior for the variance-covariance matrix of the random effects. This simulation is shown in the supplementary material. The folder contains:
      - *Data* folder
